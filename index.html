		<h1>Welcome to the Bannockburn Cottage Inn</h1>
		<p>	
		This cottage was established in 1911 in Cromwell. It was a farm. In the 1990s, the third owner of the 
		farm found that there were more and more travellers but there were not many hotels in Cromwell. 
		Therefore, they decided to change the farm into a hotel. <br><br> The current owners are Jimmy and Jenny 
		Oaks who used to own an orchard in Cromwell before retiring from the orcharding business and 
		purchasing the hotel from the previous owners. <br><br> The couple have a passion for stone based interior 
		design, which led them to choosing the older building. Before the couple was married, Jenny Craig 
		worked as a weight consultant in America. She was passionate about health and good food. She studied 
		Nutrition at Oklahoma University and was top of the course. After ten years of working in America 
		she moved to New Zealand to further increase the reach of her brand. <br><br> Before Jimmy met Jenny, 
		he owned the famous pie brand Jimmy’s Pies which is renowned all around New Zealand. As a young adult 
		he studied Consumer Food Science at the University of Otago which helped him as a young pâtissier.
		Stone Lodge is just a short drive from the beautiful Cromwell. Surrounded by the continuous rocky hills 
		and fields of luscious green grass.<br><br> The booming town of Cromwell attracts thousands of tourists every 
		year to pick the country's finest cherries and a whole range of other stone fruits (as shown by the 
		big fruit monument). The warm summer's breeze whisps the delectable scent of these nommy fruits 
		into Stone Lodge for all of our guests to sniff to their heart's content.<br><br> But the fruit isn’t the only 
		attraction in Cromwell! The lively nightclubs attract all the hip millennials and there is even a 
		daycare right beside it in case you can’t find a babysitter in time!
